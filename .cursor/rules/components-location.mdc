 ### Components Location Rule

This rule establishes standards for component organization in the project.

## Component Directory Structure

- All components MUST be placed in the root `/components` directory
- Components should NOT be placed inside the `/app` directory
- The only exception is for `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, and `error.tsx` files that are required by Next.js App Router

## Organization Guidelines

- Group related components in subdirectories under `/components`
- Use clear, descriptive names for component files and directories
- Keep component files focused and single-responsibility
- Export components through index files in each subdirectory

## Examples

âœ… Correct structure:
/components
/admin
StatsCard.tsx
/ui
Button.tsx
/articles
ArticleCard.tsx
