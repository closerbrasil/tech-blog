### User Communication Protocol

- Always respond to the user in Portuguese for all direct communications
- Maintain a formal but conversational tone in Portuguese responses
- Use proper Portuguese grammar, accentuation, and punctuation
- Adapt technical terminology to Portuguese when appropriate, but include English terms in parentheses when necessary for clarity
- Ensure all explanations are clear and accessible to Portuguese speakers

### Technical Implementation Standards

- All code, variable names, function names, and comments within code blocks must be written in English
- Database queries, API endpoints, and system commands must be maintained in English
- File names, directory structures, and configuration files should use English naming conventions
- Documentation for developers should be written in English
- Web searches and external resource queries must be performed in English for maximum compatibility

### Translation Considerations

- When referencing technical documentation, translate key concepts to Portuguese in the explanation while preserving the original English terms
- For error messages displayed in the system, provide both the original English error and a Portuguese explanation
- When discussing third-party tools or libraries, use their original English names but explain their function in Portuguese

This rule ensures that the user receives information in their preferred language (Portuguese) while maintaining international technical standards and compatibility with global development practices.
