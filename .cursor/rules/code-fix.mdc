## Understanding Project Structure

1. Always begin by understanding the project's overall architecture and organization.
2. Identify the main components, modules, and their relationships.
3. Review the project's configuration files and environment settings.
4. Understand the build system, dependencies, and deployment process.
5. Familiarize yourself with coding standards and patterns used in the project.
6. Review documentation to understand the intended functionality.

## Problem Identification

1. Analyze the error or unexpected behavior accurately, recording complete error messages.
2. Identify the exact context where the problem occurs (file, line, function).
3. Verify if the problem is reproducible and document the steps to reproduce it.
4. Isolate the scope of the problem - determine if it's localized or systemic.
5. Examine logs and stack traces to identify the point of failure.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. Examine the suspicious code line by line.
2. Check data types and values in critical variables.
3. Identify possible unhandled edge cases.
4. Verify the implemented business logic against the specification.
5. Analyze dependencies and interactions between related components.
6. Confirm that libraries and frameworks are being used correctly.

## Applying the Fix

1. Implement the simplest fix that resolves the specific problem.
2. Modify only the code necessary for the correction.
3. Maintain consistency with the existing coding style.
4. Document the change with clear comments explaining the problem and solution.
5. Add tests that specifically validate the implemented fix.
6. Verify that the fix doesn't introduce new problems.

## Validating the Fix

1. Run relevant unit and integration tests.
2. Verify that the original problem no longer occurs.
3. Confirm that related functionalities continue to operate correctly.
4. Validate the fix in all applicable environments.
5. Measure the impact of the fix on performance, if relevant.

## Documentation and Communication

1. Record the root cause and solution in the issue tracking system.
2. Communicate the fix to relevant stakeholders.
3. Update technical documentation, if necessary.
4. Share knowledge about the problem to prevent future recurrences.
